# command-loopy

A lightweight Python command loop runner inspired by [The Elm
Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) and the
[bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) implementation in Go.
Its most common use case is for building command line or terminal user
interfaces but is not opinionated about what happens during the "view" phase of
the loop.
